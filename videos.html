    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>From a young age, it was always my dream to be a YouTuber. Inspired by people such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/stampylongnose">Stampylongnose</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ZackScottGames">ZackScottGames</a>, I absolutely fell in love with the idea of broadcasting myself. As a Gen Z baby, YouTube has been a part of my life practically from day one. My childhood consisted of getting home from school, throwing my bag off my shoulder, and sitting down with my iPad to watch all the latest Minecraft videos. I vividly remember learning the lyrics to several Minecraft song parodies off by heart (Yes! I was that Kid :{ ), and spending the rest of my time yearning.</p>

    <p>In 2014, at 10 years old, I would finally make that dream of becoming a YouTuber a reality when I made my first channel, and published my first video, a tour of a Lego Science Lab I made:</p>

    </div>

    <p>However, like many things in my life, I quickly lost interest and moved on. Over the years, I would upload just two more videos to that channel. A Robbie Rotten meme, and a Portal 2 No commentary let's play video. By that point, my dreams of running a YouTube channel were dead in the water.</p>

    <p>That was all until 2019, when I was struck by a sudden inspiration. I was going to re-boot my YouTube dreams with a brand new channel. October, 2019, I had filmed a few skits for myself. Nothing special. In fact, looking back on them makes me cringe. But it was a start, and the inspiration treadmill was running. I would name my channel PitchFunny TV for no other reason than it was a running in joke at the time that I would describe everything by adding Pitch at the start of the word, as in Pitch Black. This had it’s obvious issues, of course. Notably, it’s association with Football. Pitch Funny was not a Football channel. I continued uploading videos to it, with little success, when in 2020, I decided to rename my channel to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@whodidwhatjohn4728">Whodidwhatjohn</a>.</p>

    <p>Whodidwhatjohn was the start of something. One of my earliest PitchFunny videos was an acapella of the game of thrones theme. Whodidwhatjohn inspired me, and I decided that that was going to be the route to take from that point on. Over the next couple of years, I would upload more acapella’s, eventually de-listing all of my old comedy skits.</p>

    </div>

    <p>As Whodidwhatjohn settled into its new space, I began to branch out. I did reviews, vlogs, original music, amongst others. Eventually, it got to a point where I realised that Whodidwhatjohn was becoming too varied, and I needed a place for all my unedited, less refined content. Enter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JohnnyStrangeBizarre">Johnny Strange</a>.</p>

    <p>Johnny Strange was a fresh start. A place for all my low-effort posts, as well as content that didn’t belong on Whodidwhatjohn. From Johnny Strange’s inception, I started uploading Shorts. The shorts very quickly got noticed, and Johnny Strange soon ended up with over 70 subscribers, matching that of Whodidwhatjohn.</p>

    <p>And this takes us up to where we are today. As my skill-set and ideas grow larger, I found myself longing for my own space to share my ideas. When I was messing around with AI, I discovered that Copilot could build websites. This is perfect, I thought. This is exactly what I needed. I’m a creative individual, but I’m not a website builder. I needed something to put it all together for me, and like an angel from Heaven, Copilot offered its services. So here we are. On this page, and the following pages, you will find an assortment of videos that, for whatever reason, I deemed worthy of being uploaded on here. There will be plenty of exclusive goodies for you to feast your eyes and ears upon, as well as short documentaries (for lack of a better word) on the making of videos I have uploaded to YouTube.</p>
