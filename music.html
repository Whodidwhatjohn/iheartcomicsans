    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>During the Covid lockdowns, I discovered a passion for music. Struck by an insatiable boredom one day, I was shown a YouTube recommendation for a video that allowed you to play a piano keyboard within YouTube itself. It relied on YouTube’s jump feature, utilising the numpad to jump to specific spots on the video where a corresponding musical note would be played. I had a lot of fun that day and despite the keyboard being relativity simplistic, I managed to recreate a few themes from the Sonic the Hedgehog Franchise just by ear alone.</p>

    <p>As cool as that was however, its limitations were obvious, and I soon found myself needing something more. I eventually moved to Bandlab, which offered a similar system of piano playing via Qwerty keyboard. A few days after tinkering around, my Mum heard my tunes and suggested I ask for a midi keyboard for my 17th Birthday later that year. While initially, I was against the idea, seeing it as something that would quickly be abandoned, I eventually warmed up to the idea. In the end, I ended up getting my first midi keyboard, as well as a book for learning the Piano from scratch, professor Alfred’s All in One Piano course, and a licence for Ableton Pro.</p>

    <p>I very quickly fell in love with Piano, and the process of learning Piano. Soon after, I was playing recognisable tunes, as well as some of my own, and I was feeling really proud of myself. In March 2021 however, we ended up moving house, and with it, all my old habits died. Settling into the new house, and new routines, was difficult, and Piano fell by the wayside. As well as this, I became painfully aware of gaps in my knowledge and technique, further driving me away from Piano. With all this in mind, and with my prior history of dropping things after a few months of obsession, I found a new resolve. I was not going to let Piano escape me. I had finally found something I really enjoyed, and I never wanted to let go of that. A month later, I signed myself up for professional lessons.</p>

    <p>Just 4 short years later now and I have since achieved up to a Grade 5 in performance, and very soon, I will be taking my Grade 5 theory exam. I am a competent pianist, frequently impressing people with my wealth of knowledge and my ability to perform from the heart, and I have several of my own unique compositions in tow. On the pages spread out below, you will find links and downloads to some of my compositions, as well as videos of performances I have done. Most of my original music lies in the realm of electronic and synthesiser music, although I am now venturing into the realm of Jazz improvisation, too.</p>
